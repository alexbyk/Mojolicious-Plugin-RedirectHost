# ABSTRACT: Redirects requests from mirrors to the main host (useful for SEO)

=head1 SYNOPSIS


Generates 301 redirect from C<http://mirror.main.host/path?query> to C<http://main.host/path?query>
  
  # Mojolicious
  $app->plugin('RedirectHost', host => 'main.host');
  
  # Mojolicious::Lite
  plugin RedirectHost => { host => 'main.host' };

All requests with C<Host> header that is not equal to the C<host> option will be redirected to the main host

	www.main.host       => main.host
	another.io/foo?bar  => main.host/foo?bar
	etc...

You can point as many domains to your App by DNS, as you want. It doesn't matter, all of them will become a mirror. An equivalent apache .htaccess file looks like

	RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST}   !^alexbyk.com
	RewriteRule  ^(.*)		http://alexbyk.com/$1 [R=301,L]

It would be better if you'll be using per mode config files (your_app.production.conf etc). This would make possible
to redirect only in production enviropment (but do nothing while coding your app)

=head1 OPTIONS/USAGE

=head2 C<host>

Main domain. All requests to the mirrors will be redirected to the C<host> (domain)
This option is required. Without it plugin do nothing

=head2 C<code>

  $app->plugin('RedirectHost', host => 'main.host', code => 302);

Type of redirection. Default 301 (Moved Permanently)

=head2 C<er> (except /robots.txt)

  $app->plugin('RedirectHost', host => 'main.host', er => 1);

If true, requests like /robots.txt will not be redirected but rendered. That's for Yandex search engine.
If you want to change a domain but worry about yandex TIC, it's recomended to make it possible for Yandex to read your robots.txt
with new Host directive. If so, that's exactly what you're looking for

=head2 C<silent>

If C<silent> is true, doesn't write messages to the error log even if L</host> is missing.
Default value is C<false>

You can configure plugin in a production config file and define C<silent> in a development config.

	# app.production.conf
	# redirect_host => {host => 'main.host'},

	# app.development.conf: 
	# redirect_host => {silent => 1},


=head1 CONFIG

You can pass options to the plugin with the help of your config. Use C<redirect_host> key.

  $app->config(redirect_host => {host => 'main.host'});

TIP: use per mode config files (yourapp.production.conf) to pass parameters to the plugin to avoid redirection during
development process
